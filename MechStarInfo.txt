Mechanical Stars in ENZO!
This method is based on Hopkins et al. 2017 (FIRE-2 collaboration). 
The supernova rates, winds energy are taken from that paper where they were generated using Starburst 99 simulation.

The method uses a cloud of 27 particles that are coupled (momentum and mass) to the origin particle.  
They are then CIC deposited to the surrounding grid.  Several parameters are introduced to control this 
star maker method (found in star_maker_mechanical.F)
  
    StellarWinds  = binary (0-off, 1-on)
    SingleSN      = binary (0-off, 1-on: supernova are modeled probabilistically, off uses no supernova feedback)
    DepositUnresolvedEnergyAsThermal = binary (0-off, 1-on: Energy is reduced outside the cooling radius if
                                  r_cool is unresolved by du = (dx/r_cool)^-6.5.
                                  if on, the remaining energy will be deposited in the host cell as thermal energy)
    AnalyticSNRShellMass  = binary (0-off, 1-on: When coupling outside the immediate supernova, there is a modification to
                                    to increase the mass coupled to neighbors (this mass is removed from the host cell, 
                                    not the star particle), which simulates the increased shell mass of the SNR.
                                    It is calculated by calculating v_shell (Cioffi 1988), and then modifying 
                                    m_coupled as m_couple = p_couple/v_shell)
    NEvents       = if > 0; testing flag to set number of supernova to enable per particle.  Each supernova will go off 
                                                    in sequential timesteps
    StarMakerMaximumMass = maximum allowable mass including subsequent formation after the initial particle formation.
                                            sets the maximum timestep at the star formation level
    StarMakerMaximumFormationMass = maximum initial mass of star particle.  should be > 1000 to ensure that the particle
                                               can fully sample the IMF.
    StarMakerMinimumRefinementLevel = minimum level you would like star formation to occur.  this limits the timestep
                                       on this and higher levels so that P(SNe) < 1..
    StarMakerOverDensityThreshold = minimum overdensity you would like star formation to occur at. usually the density
                                                    expected at StarMakerMinimumRefinementLevel
    If running TestStarParticle
      NumberOfTestStars = number of stars you want in the box
      clusterRadius = maximum portion of box to allow star particles (fraction of box).  the particles will only
                    be placed within the box within [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] +/- clusterRadius
